> [!my-definition-callout] Algorithm
>
> Step by Step unambiguous set of instructions to solve a problem or achieve an outcome.

> [!NOTE] Merits of algorithm
> 
> Criteria to judge merits of an algorithm
> 
> - **Correctness / Accuracy**
> - **Efficiency**
> - Scalability
> - Complexity or Simplicity
> - Adaptability
> - Ease of Implementation

> [!Attention] Correctness vs Accuracy
> 
> ### Correctness:
> 
> Algorithm must produce logically sound and error-free results for all valid inputs to be called correct.
> 
> - **Logical soundness:** Does the algorithm follow a sound and consistent set of rules?
> - **Absence of errors:** Are there any bugs, logical inconsistencies, or edge cases where the algorithm produces incorrect results?
> - **Compliance with specifications:** Does the algorithm fulfil all the requirements and constraints outlined in its design?
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Accuracy
> 
> Algorithm must produce outputs that match with true or expected value, especially in cases where there might be some inherent uncertainty or approximation involved.
> 
> - **Closeness to the desired outcome:** How close are the algorithm's results to the ideal or most accurate solution?
> - **Minimization of errors:** How effectively does the algorithm reduce errors or deviations from the true value?
> - **Approximation quality:** If the algorithm involves approximations or heuristics, how accurate are those approximations?
