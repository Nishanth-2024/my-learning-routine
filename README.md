# My Learning Routine

- Welcome to My-Journal! This is my personal project where I document my daily learnings as a software developer.
- The goal is to keep track of new things I learn every day and also to recollect something I might have forgotten.

## About

This repository is a collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across various languages and technologies.

## Topics

The topics I explore are constantly evolving based on what I'm currently learning or working on.

## Note

This is a personal project for my own use. It's a space for me to document my journey and growth as a software developer.

## Confession

- I have started similar projects n number of times and abandoned due to `Procrastination`. I wish this would not end up in the same dumpster
