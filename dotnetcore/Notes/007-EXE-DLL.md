# Difference Between EXE and DLL

## EXE (Executable) Files

- **Purpose**: EXE files are standalone applications that can be executed directly by the operating system.
- **Entry Point**: Contains an entry point (e.g., `Main` method) which is the starting point for execution.
- **Process**: When an EXE file is run, the operating system creates a separate process for it.
- **Usage**: Typically used for applications that need to run independently, such as software programs and utilities

## DLL (Dynamic Link Library) Files

- **Purpose**: DLL files are libraries that contain code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously.
- **Entry Point**: Does not contain an entry point, so it cannot be executed on its own.
- **Process**: Runs within the process of the calling application, sharing its memory space.
- **Usage**: Used to provide functions and procedures that can be reused by different applications, such as shared libraries and device drivers

## Key Differences

1. **Execution**:
   - **EXE**: Can run independently.
   - **DLL**: Cannot run independently; must be called by an EXE or another DLL.
2. **Entry Point**:
   - **EXE**: Contains an entry point.
   - **DLL**: Does not contain an entry point.
3. **Process Creation**:
   - **EXE**: Creates a new process.
   - **DLL**: Runs within the process of the calling application.
4. **Reusability**:
   - **EXE**: Not typically reused by other applications.
   - **DLL**: Designed to be reused by multiple applications
