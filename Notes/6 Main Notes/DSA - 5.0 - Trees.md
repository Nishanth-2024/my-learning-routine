> [!my-definition-callout] Tree
>
> A tree is a *hierarchical*, *non-linear* *data structure* or *abstract data type* that stores a collection of elements a way where,
> 
> - It has a special node called the root
> - Every node except the root has exactly one parent node

> [!NOTE] Key Points:
> 
> - *Hierarchical:* Elements are organized in a parent-child relationship, like a family tree.
> - *Non-linear:* Unlike lists or arrays, elements are not stored in a sequential order.
> - *Nodes:* Represent elements or data within the tree.
> - *Edges:* Represent the connections between nodes.
> - *Root:* The topmost node, the starting point of the tree.
> - *Leaves*: Nodes at the bottom of the tree with no children.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root] --> B(Left Child)
    A --> C(Right Child)
    B --> D(Grandchild 1)
    B --> E(Grandchild 2)
    C --> F(Grandchild 3)
```

> [!NOTE] Key Terms in a Tree
>
> - *Root:* Node with No Parent
> - *Edge:* Link from Parent to child
> - *Leaf:* Node that has no child
> - *Sibling:* Nodes with same parent
> - *Ancestor and Descendant:* A node `p` is an ancestor of node `q` and `q` is a descendant of `p` if there exists a path from `root` to `q` and `p` appears on the path.
> - *depth:* length of a path from root node to given node is the depth of given node
> - *Level:* set of all nodes in a tree at a given depth
> - *height*
>   - of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to a _leaf_ node in its subtree.
>   - of a tree is height of it's root node
> - *Size* of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself

```mermaid
graph TD
    a["a (h:3)"] --> b["b (h:1)"]
    a --> c["c (h:2)"]
    b --> d["d (h:0)"]
    b --> e["e (h:0)"]
    c --> f["f (h:1)"]
    c --> g["g (h:0)"]
    f --> h["h (h:0)"]
```

> [!my-definition-callout] Skew Trees
> 
> - If every node in a tree has only one child (except leaf nodes) then we call such trees *skew trees*.
> - If every node has only left child then we call them *left skew trees*.
> - Similarly , if every node has only right child then we call them *right skew trees*.

> [!my-definition-callout] Binary Tree
> 
> A tree is called Binary Tree if each and every node in the tree has at most 2 children
> 
> - An empty tree is also a binary tree

> [!my-definition-callout] Strict Binary Tree
> 
> Each node has exactly two children or no child at all. In other words, no node has only one child.
> 
> *Key Points:*
> 
> - Every internal node (non-leaf node) has exactly two children.
> - Leaf nodes have no children.
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>   A((A)) --> B((B))
>   A --> C((C))
>   B --> D((D))
>   B --> E((E))
> ```

> [!my-definition-callout] Full Binary Tree
>
> Strict Binary Tree with all leaf nodes being at same level
> (or)
> All nodes except the leaves have two children. All leaf nodes are at the same level.
> 
> *Key Points:*
> 
> - A full binary tree is a type of strict binary tree.
> - All internal nodes have two children.
> - All leaf nodes are at the same depth.
>
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>   A((A)) --> B((B))
>   A --> C((C))
>   B --> D((D))
>   B --> E((E))
>   C --> F((F))
>   C --> G((G))
> ```

> [!my-definition-callout] Complete Binary Tree
> A binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
> 
> *Key Points:*
> 
> - Nodes are filled from left to right at each level.
> - The last level may or may not be full, but if it's not, the nodes are filled from left to right.

> ```mermaid
> graph TD

>   A --> C((C))
>   B --> D((D))
>   B --> E((E))
>   C --> F((F))

> [!Attention] Operations on Binary Trees
>
> Basic Operations
> - *Inserting* an element into a tree
> - *Deleting* an element from a tree
> - *Searching* for an element
> - *Traversing* the tree
> 
> Auxiliary Operations
> - Finding the *size* of the tree
> - Finding the *height* of the tree
> - Finding the level which has maximum sum
> - Finding the *least common ancestor (LCA)* for a given pair of nodes, and many more.

> [!NOTE] Traversal
> 
> - Preorder (DLR) Traversal
>   - Process Node before either of subtrees
> - Inorder (LDR) Traversal
>   - Node is visited between subtrees
> - Postorder (LRD) Traversal
>   - Node is visited after both subtrees
> 
> *More Traversals:*
> - There is another traversal method which does not depend on the above orders and it is: *Level Order Traversal*
