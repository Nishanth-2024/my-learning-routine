```Typescript
function fib(n) {
  return (n <= 1) ? n : (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))
}

function factorial(n) {
  return (n <= 2) ? n : (n * fib(n-1))
}
```

> | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Mechanism**     | Function calls itself.                                                              | Loop (`for`, `while`).                                                           |
> | **Approach**      | Breaks problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems.                              | Repeats instructions until a condition is met.                                   |
> | **Code Style**    | Can be elegant for some problems.                                                   | Can be straightforward.                                                          |
> | **Memory Usage**  | *Uses call stack, thus creating memory for each recur;*potentially stack overflow_. | *Generally less memory use unless memory is explicitly created inside the loop*. |
> | **Performance**   | *Can be slower due to function call overhead*.                                      | *Generally faster*.                                                              |
> | **Readability**   | *Can be harder to understand*.                                                      | Often easier to read.                                                            |
> | **Applicability** | Natural recursive structures (e.g., trees).                                         | Repetitive tasks.                                                                |
> | **Debugging**     | *Can be challenging*.                                                               | Easier to debug.                                                                 |
