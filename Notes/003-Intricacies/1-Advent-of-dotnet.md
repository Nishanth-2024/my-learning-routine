## .NET Framework Milestones

1. **.NET Framework 1.0 (2002)**:
   - Introduced managed programming with the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Framework Class Library (FCL).
   - Unified language for GUI and web development.

2. **.NET Framework 1.1 (2003)**:
   - Minor updates and improvements.

3. **.NET Framework 2.0 (2005)**:
   - Introduced generics, partial classes, and the `yield` keyword for iterators.

   - A cross-platform, open-source version of .NET, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.
   - It also comes with managed programming via Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Framework Class Library (FCL).

2. **.NET Core 2.0 (2017)**:
   - Enhanced performance and added more APIs, making it easier to port code from the .NET Framework.

3. **.NET Core 3.0 (2019)**:
   - Added support for Windows desktop applications (WPF and Windows Forms) and significant performance improvements.

4. **.NET 5 (2020)**:
   - Unified .NET Framework and .NET Core into a single platform, simplifying the development process.

5. **.NET 6 (2021)**:
   - Continued the unification effort, bringing further performance enhancements, new APIs, and improved support for cloud, mobile, and IoT applications.

6. **.NET 7 (2022)**:
   - Focused on improving developer productivity, performance, and expanding platform support.
